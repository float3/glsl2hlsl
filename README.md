# glsl2hlsl

Slightly cursed WIP ShaderToy to Unity (ShaderLab) transpiler.

Sorry if the code gives you an aneurism.

# Features

- Converts a fairly decent chunk of shadertoy shaders to usable unity shaders
- Can attempt to automatically find and extract properties from the shader and put then in the inspector
- Can attempt to automatically make raymarched/raytraced shaders 3D
- Can download shaders directly from the shadertoy API given a link
- Synthesizes a usable unity material and .meta file when using download feature

# Some cool shaders to try it on

# To do

- Better support for preprocessor directives in any context
- Multiline macro support
- Implement various missing sampler-related functions such as textureSize, textureLodOffset etc.
- A few properties defined by shadertoy (iDate, iChannelResolution...) are missing
- Refactor

# Build

`cargo build`

# Usage

`glsl2hlsl <fileToConvert>`

Or just use the website :P
